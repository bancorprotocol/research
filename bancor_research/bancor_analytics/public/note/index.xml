      <description>Trade Analysis by Category We evaluated trade data on Bancor in the date range 2021-01-01 to 2022-02-13.
Tokens were divided into the following categories:
 STABLE: USDC, USDT, DAI ETH: ETH, WETH BTC: WBTC, renBTC ALT: All others (including BNT)  Complete dataset (i.e. All-legs) Unsurprisingly, ALT-ALT category comprises ~50% of volume due to 2-hops going through BNT. The next biggest categories are ETH-ALT which makes 30%, and STABLE-ALT 14%. The proportion of fees is very similar with the notable differences being the ALT-ALT and STABLE-ALT have higher Fee/Vol then ETH-ALT and so account for proportionately more fees.</description>

      <description>This is the 3rd book I am writing &amp;ndash; the first one was part of the PRMIA Handbook and the second one was my book on financial regulations, and every time I decided about 2 seconds after I started writing that writing in Word is not and option. For the PRMIA Handbook this was a no-brainer &amp;ndash; I had to include a lot of formulas, and the old formula editor sucked even more than the current one, so it was clear that something like LaTeX was the only option.</description>
