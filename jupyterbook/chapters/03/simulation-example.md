# Simulation Example

**Bancor3** Simulations is an open-source model and simulation framework developed by the **Bancor Research Team**.

Bancor3 Simulations aims to build infrastructure and knowledge for rigorous Bancor v3 analysis, so as to allow for the
full power of Bancor Protocol to become a core building block in DeFi.

**We invite any project building on Bancor3 to join our** [**Discord Channel**](https://discord.com/invite/pe7EfaR)

- **Analyze existing Balancer Pools** using on-chain transaction data, understand pool characteristics, strengths, and
  weaknesses

- **Gain intuition** by exploring pool variants, observe system behavior over time, derive the most valuable monitoring
  metrics for your use case

- **Run experiments** based on historical transactions, mix historical and synthetic transactions to model particular
  market scenarios

- **Develop and test** adaptive Dynamic AMM solutions, like Dynamic Weights Changing, test and optimize controls and
  feedback loops

- Model agent behavior and apply Reinforcement Learning to **run stress tests** for a proposed system design

All research and models are available through open source repositories, and will be further developed by **Bancor
Research Team**.
