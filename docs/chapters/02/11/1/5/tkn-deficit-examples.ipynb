    "A TKN is in deficit if the total vault balance is less than or equal to the staked amount, after accounting for the exit fee. It is necessary to separate the vault balance into the trading liquidity (b), and non-trading liquidity (c) components; b + c is the vault balance of TKN:\n",

    "where e is the TKN balance of the staking ledger, and n is the withdrawal fee (e.g. 0.0025, or 0.25%). So long as the above expression is True, the protocol is in an effective deficit (i.e. the quantity of TKN is insufficient to reimburse the totality of all user stakes). In this state, it is possible that some users will receive partial reimbursement in BNT. However, the protocol will also attempt to reimburse users entirely in TKN using the reverse of the repricing strategy described for the surplus case - essentially to recapture TKN from the external markets. The following paragraphs will explore the three different situations that cover the discrete behaviors of the withdrawal algorithm during a deficit state of TKN.\n",

    "As before, the potential for abuse is the most important component of the decision tree. The same thresholds, hlim and hmax, defined previously are used again here; however, the hmax calculation is modified to account for the reversed direction:\n",

    "\n",
    "The hlim and hmax terms are used in exactly the same fashion as before; they define the maximum value for x that is allowable without creating a possible abuse incentive. Therefore, the user's withdrawal amount (x) must be less than both hlim and hmax:\n",

    "To examine this further, consider the following case: the staking ledger reports a staked balance of 2,000 TKN (e), the vault balance of TKN is 1,800 TKN (b+c), the TKN trading pool has 1,000 TKN (b) and 1,000 BNT (a) in available liquidity.

    "In this case, hlim evaluates to 888.888889 TKN, and hmax evaluates to 1138.958507 TKN. As the user's withdrawal amount (x) is less than both of these values, there must be sufficient non-trading TKN in the vault to support the withdrawal, and there is no financial incentive to create the withdrawal for the purpose of back running. Therefore the protocol can attempt to recover a small amount of TKN from the outside markets.\n",

    "Note the opposite behavior of the protocol, compared to the surplus case. During a deficit, the algorithm reacts by quoting a higher price for TKN. The same considerations applied in the previous argument also apply here; if and when the pool returns to balance (defined as state of the pool before the withdrawal was executed), the relative deficit of TKN compared to the staked balance will remain constant, (ignoring vortex fee effects). The number of BNT minted to the trading liquidity, and the amount of TKN taken from the trading liquidity, is determined such that a hypothetically perfect arbitrage trade would return the deficit to its pre-withdrawal value. As before, there is no specific requirement for the implied arbitrage opportunity to close immediately, or even eventually.\n",

    "The method is abusable if the withdrawal value (x) is greater than hlim or hmax. To examine a case where these abusability thresholds are exceeded, consider a scenario nearly identical to that presented above, but where the TKN balance of the staking ledger (e) is increased to 2,200 TKN. Therefore, the vault balance of TKN remains at 1,800 TKN (b+c), the TKN trading pool has 1,000 TKN (b) and 1,000 BNT (a) in available liquidity, and the user confirms a withdrawal for 100 TKN (x).\n",

    "The most intuitive way to interpret this result is to add the TKN and BNT amounts together. In this case, the BNT/TKN rate is precisely 1:1, which makes it easy. The S and T outputs represent an amount of TKN, and BNT tokens sent to the user, respectively. Since these tokens have the same value, their sum should represent the total value the user was expecting, save for the exit fee. In this case, the sum is precisely 99.75, which is what we expect. These BNT tokens received in reimbursement are minted at withdrawal, and do not originate from inside the protocol. While this example uses a 1:1 valuation of BNT:TKN, the output T handles any BNT valuation.\n",

    "Lastly, the case wherein the hlim or hmax test fails, and where it is impossible to refund the user without affecting the trading liquidity, should be considered.
