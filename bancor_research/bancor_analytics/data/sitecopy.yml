# this file contains copy for the home page and for common elements across the various pages,
# especially those that are provided as html and where the copy is often hard to find
# within a template, use the following to access that data
#
#   {{ .Site.Data.sitecopy.xxx }}
#
# where xxx is the name of the field (or a dot-separated field path as the case may be).
# 
# for highly strucutured data the following way of accessing it often is efficient
#
#   {{ with .Site.Data.sitecopy.path.to.record }}
#   {{ .item }}
#   {{ end }}
