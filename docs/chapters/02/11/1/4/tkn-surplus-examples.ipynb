    "It is important to note that during a surplus, the algorithm reacts by moving the price of BNT vs TKN in the pool; note that the pool began with a spot rate of 1:1, and arrived at a slightly higher price for BNT at the conclusion of the process. This repricing is such that, if and when the pool returns to balance (defined as state of the pool before the withdrawal was executed), the relative surplus of TKN compared to the staked balance will remain constant, (ignoring vortex fee effects). In essence, either the valuation of BNT is allowed to increase vs TKN, or the closing of a future arbitrage opportunity positively affects the total BNT balance of the protocol. The number of BNT burned from the trading liquidity is equal to the amount that would be returned in a hypothetically perfect arbitrage, assuming the rate inside the pool is in agreement with consumer expectations (i.e. the rest of the market). This anticipatory BNT is part of the process - while BNT is lost from the trading liquidity in this case, the protocol does not relinquish its pool tokens. It might be helpful to think of this as a small trade of TKN to BNT having just occurred. Whether or not the apparent arbitrage opportunity is closed immediately is irrelevant; for example, it is likely that these small adjustments will occasionally close existing arbitrage opportunities. It is only important that a compensatory action is taken by the protocol that addresses the implicit BNT valuation and/or its liquidity equilibrium state.\n",

    "To summarise the outcome for this scenario, the protocol gives up what is left of the non-trading TKN, and then the remaining balance is taken from the trading liquidity. Since the pool depth is directly affected, the protocol must renounce the BNT component of the pool. Previously, the variables Q and R were treated independently, as the small change in the BNT trading liquidity was akin to a simulated swap, rather than a formal withdrawal. However, in this case Q = R, as the reduction in the pool is appropriately treated as the protocol performing a withdrawal. The Q quantity is denominated in BNT, and is later processed into its equivalence in bnBNT; both the BNT and the bnBNT are destroyed, and the staked balance of BNT is adjusted down, accordingly.\n",
