**A new dawn for DeFi**

**Bancor3 Simulator** is an open-source python package developed by the **Bancor Research Team**. It's meant to assist in the design, testing, and validation of Bancor v3 tokenomics.

**We invite any project building on Bancor3 to join our** [**Discord Channel**](https://discord.com/invite/pe7EfaR). 

A quick glance at our data science, ai, and analytics roadmap:

- **Ai-sentinal** anomoly detection system, triggering early warnings and securing the nextwork against malicious actors.

- **multi-agent reinforcement learning** optimization models which automatically recommend performant (profitable, secure, etc.) network parameters for the DAO to vote on.

- **AR/VR immersive DeFi-oriented analytics** the basic building block of DeFi's most enlightened dashboards and analytics.

- A generalized component-based graph framework which can adapt to a new world where multi-chain, lending, and increasingly complex features dominate the space.

All research and models are available through open source repositories, and will be further developed by **Bancor
Research Team**.
